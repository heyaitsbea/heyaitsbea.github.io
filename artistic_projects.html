                My first time editing a short film was for my dear friend Katia! It's a heartwarming story about the struggles of being Latinx in the US.

                This <a href="https://youtu.be/o5yqfsJ3xk8"> short film </a> was produced as a project for my Intro to Media Production class, and it has a special place in my heart.

	  <span class="byline"> I have always loved music, so I loved getting to take listening to the next level.

          <p> <b> A BRIGHT NEW BOISE </b> 
          <audio controls>
						<p> I created this final sound cue for a play I sound designed for - "A Bright New Boise" by Samuel D. Hunter. This sound cue takes place at the very end of the show, where the protagonist is standing alone in a parking lot at night, surrounded by sounds of the interstate, the Rapture, and immense regret.</p>

                <br>
                
                <span> I was lucky to make my <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/school/chapel-hill/belkin-tales-review"> <b>directorial </b>debut </a>my sophomore year of college - where I got the chance to work with a small cast and a student-written script, based on the stories of Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. I was pushed into a leadership role, being entrusted in doing this piece justice. Due to limited resources for a rather period-heavy script, I had to get creative - making the audience "feel" as if they were in 18th century Russia when they were really in a small studio with wood flooring watching actors in jeans. This experience taught me to be assertive, flexible, and collaborative, and am thankful I got to apply my creative voice to this type of project.</span></p>

              <p> <b> 30 PLAYS IN 60 MINUTES (2018- present)</b> 
                <br>
                If I had to pick one experience that has shaped my creative voice - I would pick this group of people. This Neofuturist troupe is focused on brevity, honesty, and storytelling - for just 60 minutes, we perform a show composed of different pieces we devise about ourselves. They can be songs, monologues, dances, poems, slideshows, interactive activities, movement pieces, and more. I have gotten the opportunity to explore my deepest vulnerabilities and greatest passions through creating performances with this group. I have learned to appear in front of others as myself and nothing but myself, and to accept others for their genuine self as well. I get to craft my thoughts into something people eventually empathize with, and it made me feel more connected to others in a way that nothing else ever had. </p>

                <br>
                After working at the YMCA for the summer, I knew I wanted to work with kids. I was ecstatic when I found Stage Play because that meant that I got to not only hang out with kids, but share the joy of performance with them! This also served as a very special experience because I got to learn more about how theatre helps autistic children with communication. I got to be their friend, and teacher, and that was very special to me. </p>

			<h2>MUSIC AND COMPOSITION</h2>
			<span class="byline">In my free time, I love listening and composing music. </span> 
      <br> </br>
      I usually think of a chord progression (either on the guitar, ukulele, or piano), match some lyrics up to its rhythm, and just take off from there! I usually like to write about my personal experiences - often satirized by sometimes made serious and honest.
        Throughout college, I've gotten the chance to release some of my pieces into the world - for example, at a UNC Creatives of Color event (pictured below, me singing about the Filipino food "ube") as well as having one of my original compositions be 
        featured in a <a href='https://youtu.be/suy4s-IYpdg'> student film</a>!
